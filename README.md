Pitch: 

People want to do good and serve others, but it's just so hard to remember to do it. Even if you remember, it's hard to think of a service idea on the spot. Random acts generator solves both problems by reminding you to serve- randomly choosing a person from your contacts, and giving you suggestions for how to serve them.

MVP:

- Onboarding process for a new user
- Navigation present on all pages
- Ability for user to add in their contacts manually.
- Page to view a list of their added contacts, and edit or delete them.
- Page with a list of service ideas that comes with the app that can be added to and edited by the user.
- Page (with some sort of event listener) to randomize contact and random act to show the user.

Stretch: 

Enable push notifications for service reminders (for mobile app). Enable a text to be sent automatically via Twilio with the randomly generated contact and act (for web app).  Use the Google Contacts API to allow the app to view user's contacts.
